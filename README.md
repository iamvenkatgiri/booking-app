When we define the data type explicitly, we will avoid errors.
Go can understand this, when we declare a value, for example
var tickets = 50 (correct) , go will understand the type int.
when we don't declare a value to a variable, for example
var userName (wrong), we have to explicitly mention the datatype.

var userName string (correct)
